# football_modelling
This repo contains the code for the [Mathematical Modelling of Football course of Uppsala University](https://uppsala.instructure.com/courses/28112): 

It is concerned with analysis of both event and tracking data of football matches.

I played around with the data myself, but eventually lost interest because tracking data (which is the most interesting) is difficult to come by, so you end up analyzing the same matches again and again.
